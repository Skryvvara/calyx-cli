  <h1>Calyx-Cli</h1>
  <p>a humble cli for me, darkyne.</p>
</div>

## description
Calyx is a cli written in [go][golang] mostly to automate things I have to do and learn [go][golang] along the way. While this is open-source it is tailored to my needs and might not work for everyone so please keep that in mind.

## commands
### status [options]
options:
* --status value | status of the app
* --help, -h | show help (default: false)
> this is my first comamnd and doesn't really do anything. It's just there to test the cli framework.
example usage: `calyx status --status darkyne` <br>
ouput: `darkyne`

### generate [options]
options: <br>
* --bytes value, -b value | set the amount of bytes (default: 32) <br>
* --help, -h | show help (default: false) <br>
> this command generates a key by giving it an amount of bytes as options. Defaults to 32 bytes.
example usage: `calyx generate --bytes 32` <br>
output: `342b43a03a9f8aedb2a1f568e019249a6a1cf654e5dbaba9bf4410435a33eac5`
